1.  Introduction

   National Security/Emergency Preparedness priority communications
   services are operational in various countries around the world.
   While these have traditionally been only supported over cellular
   networks, the recent addition of Emergency Preparedness Communication
   Service (EPCS) to Wi-Fi 7 means that Wi-Fi now supports Multimedia
   Priority Services Communications (MPS).  This specifies preferred or
   prioritized channel access (PCA) over public/private Wi-Fi networks
   in emergency service (ES) scenarios.

   Whereas Wi-Fi 7 defines the interactions between the Wi-Fi Access
   Point (AP) and the Wi-Fi Station device for prioritized channel
   access, it does not provide an end-to-end architecture for enabling
   the EPCS on a per device basis.

Internet-Draft                 RADIUS EPCS                  October 2024


   CISRCVIII WG4 recommendations for FCC provide opportunities for
   regulatory bodies, like the FCC, to assess and promote Wi-Fi's role
   in emergency services [CSRC8-WG4].  This involves shaping rules,
   clarifying obligations, and exploring methods for handling Wi-Fi-
   enabled 911 calls, ultimately enhancing Wi-Fi's role in critical
   communications.

   Earlier deliverables from CISRCV WG8 have defined requirements for
   the role of the network within the priority services platform to
   enforce priority levels on traffic associated with priority users
   [CSRC5-WG8].  There are number of factors critical to this
   enforcement function:

   *  The priority user must be authenticated and authorized to receive
      priority treatment

   *  The network must be able to uniquely identify priority user
      traffic and associate the authorized level of priority to that
      traffic

   *  The network must then have prioritization means to apply to the
      identified traffic.

   *  For cases where networks interconnect, traffic prioritization
      indicators must be securely passed to interconnected networks for
      downstream prioritization.

   This document specifies an extension to the Remote Authentication
   Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) protocol [RFC2865] that enables a Wi-Fi
   NAS to indicate it is EPCS capable, as well as enabling a RADIUS
   server to indicate to a NAS that an authenticated user is authorized
   to receive the EPCS service.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Terminology

   Authorizing agent:

   Refers to a Federal or State entity that authenticates, evaluates,
   and makes recommendations to DHS regarding the assignment of priority
   levels.

   Service user:

   Mmeans an individual or organization to whom or which a priority
   access assignment has been made.

   Wireless service provider:

   Refers to a provider of a wireless communications service or Internet
   Protocol-based service, including commercial or private mobile
   service.  The term includes agents of the licensed provider and
   resellers of wireless service.

2.  Overiew of EPCS Provisioning

   This section provides background on how EPCS service is currently
   authorized and how that can be adapted to support Wi-Fi use cases.
   The service user engages with an authorizing agent to request the
   provision of priority service on a service provider device.  The
   service provider, in this case a cellular operator, will receive an
   indication from the authorizing agent that a subscriber has been
   authorized for priority services and will stored such an indication
   in the Home Subscriber Server (HSS).

   In the case that the cellular operator is also operating as a Wi-Fi
   Ideneity Provider, the operator can mirror the authorization
   information in their Wi-Fi AAA system, as illustrated in Figure 1.

4.1.  EPCS-Capable-Indication

   Description

   The EPCS-Capable-Indication (TBA1) Attribute allows a RADIUS NAS to
   indicate to a RADIUS server that it is EPCS capable.

   One EPCS-Capable-Indication Attribute MAY be included in an Access-
   Request packet.

   A summary of the EPCS-Capable-Indication Attribute format is shown in
   Figure 3.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

      The field is 2 octets, containing a 16-bit unsigned integer that
      represents whether the NAS supports EPCS and how the EPCS service
      can be invoked.  This document defines three values used with the
      EPCS-Capable-Indication attribute:

      0     The NAS does not support EPCS.

      1     The provider of the NAS has elected to provide support
            for priority services to authorized users at all times
            [FCC].

      2     The provider of the NAS has elected to provide support
            for priority services on a per EPCS-flow basis.

   The EPCS-Subscription-Info (TBA2) Attribute allows a RADIUS Server to
   indicate to a NAS that a user is authorized to receive priority
   servie.

   One EPCS-Subscription-Info Attribute MAY be included in an Access-
   Accept packet and its presence indicates the authenticated user is
   authorized to receive priority service.

   A summary of the EPCS-Subscription-Infon Attribute format is shown in
   Figure 4.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.
